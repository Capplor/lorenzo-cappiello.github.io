I am a PhD Student at King's College London. As a computational social scientist I explore mentalisation through two lenses: (1) developing novel models (e.g., Mind-space frameworks) that capture how people infer traits and intentions from behavior, and (2) using sociocultural approaches to study lay theories of mind qualitatively. My mixed-methods work integrates belief elicitation, Bayesian modeling, and immersive environments (e.g., Minecraft) to bridge lay-person psychology and algorithmic accounts of social cognition.

To explore models of mentalisation, I have decided to elicit participants beliefs and integrate them in model-base algorithms, exploring the extent to which they are informative in predicting their performance. I believe understanding others can be broken down into two sub-processes, Social Categorisation and Causal Inference. In other words, we need to know the kind of person we are mentalising and the kind of things they are most likely to do. More specifically, I am interested in understanding *WHERE* in the mentalisation process people go wrong and be able to locate a possible "site" of intervention.

To explore lay theories of Mind, I conduct qualitative interviews, focus groups and LLM-based questionnaires to explore possible algorithms behind people's mentalisation as well as their perception of social (latent) traits or types. Do people know the difference between mental states and emotions? Do they use personality dimensions or rely on star signs? How do they derive star signs from dimensions, dimensions from star signs, mental states from behaviours, behaviours from traits, traits from mental states? A sociocultural investigation can help us understand what is contigent on the cultural model people deploy when understanding others and
